# JavaScript Quiz Application


## Description

As a developer student, I want to create a quiz that will test knowledge of Javascript. This application will utilize local storage to store users score and initials.

## Usage

The start button on the welcome page will begin the quiz and start the timer. Once all of the questions have been answered, or the timer reaches 0, the quiz quiz will be finished and the score will be displayed. The user can then enter their initials to record their score and it will be stored on the Highscores page using local storage. 

The user can also clear their highscores history and retake the quiz using the two button selections on the final page.
